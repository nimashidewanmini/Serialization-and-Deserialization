# Serialization and Deserialization 

## Introduction

Serialization involves transforming an object into a format that can be conveniently stored or transmitted, often as a byte stream. Conversely, deserialization refers to converting a byte stream back into an object. These procedures play a key role in a range of computing scenarios, like preserving an object's state to a file, sending data across a network, or enabling communication among various system components.

Person class that implements the Serializable interface. The SerializePerson class demonstrates how to serialize a Person object to a file called person.ser. The DeserializePerson class shows how to read the serialized data from the file and convert it back into a Person object.





## Benefits of Serialization and Deserilization

- Persistence: Objects can be saved in a file or database and retrieved later, preserving their state across different occurrences of a program.

- Communication: Serialized objects can be transmitted over a network to other systems, enabling distributed computing and facilitating client-server communication.

- Caching: Serialized objects can be stored in a cache to enhance performance by avoiding redundant computations.

- Deep Copy: Serialization can be utilized to produce deep replicas of objects, ensuring that all internal objects are likewise copied.

## Mechanism of Serialization and Deserilization

Serialization usually entails transforming an object into a byte sequence containing details about the object's type and field values. This byte sequence can subsequently be saved to a file, transmitted over a network, or stored in memory. Deserialization comprises the act of parsing this byte sequence, rebuilding the object, and reinstating its state.

In Java, serialization is often handled using the Serializable interface and the ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream classes. An object that implements the Serializable interface can be serialized by writing it to an ObjectOutputStream. To deserialize an object, the byte stream is read from an ObjectInputStream and converted back into the original object.
